Copy emoji from any other server to your server.

[Invite the bot.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1095088210855604347&permissions=1073744896&scope=bot)

# Usage

Invite the bot to your server and create a channel called `#mojikopi`.

In `#mojikopi`, tag the bot with custom emojis to copy them to your server:

```
DaemonXI: @Mojikopi :thinking_bread:
Mojikopi: Copied thinking_bread to this server: :thinking_bread:
```

This bot responds only in channels named `#mojikopi`, so create that channel and
gate it to mods/admins only if you don't want normal users adding their own
emojis.
